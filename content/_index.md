Hi ✌️ my name is Javier Méndez, and this is my personal blog where I will be sharing my experiences during the Launch X's Backend program.

Consider yourself invited to read more about what I've learned and experienced during the program.

My expectations for this project are:

- Learn more about Git and GitHub
- Apply my Frontend knowledge
- Learn how to design Backend projects

🚀
