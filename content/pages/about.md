## Who am I

👋 Hi there! here you'll learn a bit about myself.

> My name is Javier Méndez, and at the time of creating this project 
> I'm a 23 years old guy, graduated in the Software Engineer major 
> from the Instituto Tecnológico de Sonora (ITSON).

So far, I already have **some** (not a lot of) experience about software 
development, its life cycle, development methodologies, good 
practices, among other things.
