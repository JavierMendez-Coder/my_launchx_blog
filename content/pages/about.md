## Who am I

üëã Hi there! here you'll learn a bit about myself.

> My name is Javier M√©ndez, and at the time of creating this project 
> I'm a 23 years old guy, graduated in the Software Engineer major 
> from the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Sonora (ITSON).

So far I already have **some** (not a lot) experience about software 
development, its life cycle, development metodologies, good practices, 
among other things.
